# About This Training

## Overview

The DUST 2025 Open Science Training program is a comprehensive educational resource designed to equip researchers with essential skills for conducting modern, transparent, and reproducible science. This training synthesizes best practices from leading open science initiatives and presents them in an accessible, practical format.

## Training Philosophy

Our approach is grounded in several core beliefs:

### Learning by Doing

Each lesson balances conceptual understanding with hands-on activities. We believe that skills are best developed through practice, reflection, and application to real-world scenarios.

### Accessibility First

Open science should be accessible to all researchers, regardless of technical background, career stage, or institutional resources. We have designed these materials to be:

- Free and openly licensed
- Self-paced with clear structure
- Jargon-free where possible, with explanations where not
- Practical and immediately applicable

### Continuous Improvement

This training is a living resource. We welcome feedback, suggestions, and contributions from the community. Open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/tswetnam/dust-2025/issues) or submit a pull request to help improve these materials.

## Who Created This?

This training was developed by synthesizing excellent materials from multiple open science initiatives:

- **CyVerse FOSS** - Foundational Open Science Skills program
- **NCEMS Pre-Summit Training** - Open science training for NCEMS community
- **Intro to GPT Workshop** - AI and prompt engineering fundamentals
- **Awesome Open Science** - Curated resources for open science tools

See the [Acknowledgments](acknowledgments.md) page for detailed attribution and credits.

## How to Use This Training

### For Individual Learners

Work through the three lessons sequentially at your own pace. Each lesson takes approximately 50 minutes and includes:

- Clear learning objectives
- Core concepts with examples
- Hands-on activities for practice
- Self-assessment questions
- Additional resources for deeper learning

Set aside dedicated time for each lesson and complete the activities to maximize learning.

### For Instructors

These materials can be used for:

- **Workshops** - Three 50-minute lessons or a half-day intensive
- **Course modules** - Integrate into methods courses or research seminars
- **Lab training** - Onboard new lab members to open science practices
- **Professional development** - Departmental or institutional training programs

All materials are licensed CC-BY 4.0, allowing you to adapt and remix as needed for your context.

**Teaching Tips:**

- Encourage discussion during activities
- Adapt examples to your discipline
- Share your own experiences with open science
- Create space for questions and concerns
- Follow up with resources specific to your field

### For Research Groups

Use these lessons to:

- Establish shared practices and standards
- Create data management protocols
- Develop ethical guidelines for AI use
- Build open science culture
- Prepare for funder requirements

Consider working through lessons together as a group, discussing how to apply concepts to your specific projects.

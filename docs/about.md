# About This Training

## Overview

The DUST 2025 Open Science Training program is a comprehensive educational resource designed specifically for the **University of Arizona DUST Superfund Research Center** community. This training equips environmental health researchers with essential skills for conducting modern, transparent, and reproducible science in the context of mine waste contamination, toxicology, and environmental remediation research.

## Why Open Science Matters for Superfund Research

As researchers studying hazardous waste sites, arsenic exposure, and environmental health impacts, open science practices are critical for:

- **Community Impact** - Sharing findings transparently with communities affected by mine tailings
- **Reproducibility** - Ensuring toxicology and exposure studies can be validated and built upon
- **Collaboration** - Facilitating multi-institutional research on complex environmental health problems
- **Compliance** - Meeting NIH Superfund Research Program data sharing requirements
- **Environmental Justice** - Making research accessible to policymakers and affected populations
- **Scientific Integrity** - Documenting methods for studies involving hazardous materials and vulnerable populations

## Training Philosophy

Our approach is grounded in several core beliefs:

### Learning by Doing

Each lesson balances conceptual understanding with hands-on activities. We believe that skills are best developed through practice, reflection, and application to real-world scenarios.

### Accessibility First

Open science should be accessible to all researchers, regardless of technical background, career stage, or institutional resources. We have designed these materials to be:

- Free and openly licensed
- Self-paced with clear structure
- Jargon-free where possible, with explanations where not
- Practical and immediately applicable

### Continuous Improvement

This training is a living resource. We welcome feedback, suggestions, and contributions from the community. Open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/tswetnam/dust-2025/issues) or submit a pull request to help improve these materials.

## Who Created This?

This training was developed by synthesizing excellent materials from multiple open science initiatives:

- **CyVerse FOSS** - Foundational Open Science Skills program
- **NCEMS Pre-Summit Training** - Open science training for NCEMS community
- **Intro to GPT Workshop** - AI and prompt engineering fundamentals
- **Awesome Open Science** - Curated resources for open science tools

## How to Use This Training

### For Individual Learners

Work through the three lessons sequentially at your own pace. Each lesson takes approximately 50 minutes and includes:

- Clear learning objectives
- Core concepts with examples
- Hands-on activities for practice
- Self-assessment questions
- Additional resources for deeper learning

Set aside dedicated time for each lesson and complete the activities to maximize learning.

### For Instructors

These materials can be used for:

- **Workshops** - Three 50-minute lessons or a half-day intensive
- **Course modules** - Integrate into methods courses or research seminars
- **Lab training** - Onboard new lab members to open science practices
- **Professional development** - Departmental or institutional training programs

All materials are licensed CC-BY 4.0, allowing you to adapt and remix as needed for your context.

**Teaching Tips:**

- Encourage discussion during activities
- Adapt examples to your discipline
- Share your own experiences with open science
- Create space for questions and concerns
- Follow up with resources specific to your field

### For Research Groups

Use these lessons to:

- Establish shared practices and standards for DUST research projects
- Create data management protocols for environmental samples and exposure data
- Develop ethical guidelines for AI use in environmental health research
- Build open science culture across toxicology, remediation, and epidemiology teams
- Prepare for NIH Superfund Research Program grant requirements
- Document protocols for handling sensitive location data from contaminated sites

Consider working through lessons together as a group, discussing how to apply concepts to mine waste studies, phytoremediation experiments, and community health research.
